Design and Implementation of an Eight-LED Sequential Lighting System Using AT89C51 Microcontroller using Proteus

##  Overview

This project presents the **design and implementation of an eight-LED sequential lighting system using the AT89C51 microcontroller**.

Eight LEDs are interfaced with **Port 2 (P2.0–P2.7)** of the AT89C51. The microcontroller controls the LEDs such that they glow one after another with a predefined time delay, producing a **running LED effect**.

The project demonstrates basic concepts of **8051 microcontroller programming, GPIO interfacing, bit manipulation, and software delay generation**.

##  Circuit Connections

The eight LEDs are connected to **Port 2** of the AT89C51.
```text
AT89C51                    LED

P2.0 ───── 330Ω ───── LED1
P2.1 ───── 330Ω ───── LED2
P2.2 ───── 330Ω ───── LED3
P2.3 ───── 330Ω ───── LED4
P2.4 ───── 330Ω ───── LED5
P2.5 ───── 330Ω ───── LED6
P2.6 ───── 330Ω ───── LED7
P2.7 ───── 330Ω ───── LED8
```

Each LED is connected through a **330 Ω current-limiting resistor**.

> **Note:** The program assumes an active-HIGH LED connection. If the hardware uses active-LOW logic, the LED patterns must be inverted.

---

##  Working Principle

The AT89C51 sends an 8-bit pattern to **Port 2**. Only one bit is set at a time, causing one LED to glow.

The sequence is:

```text
00000001 → 00000010 → 00000100 → 00001000
     ↓
00010000 → 00100000 → 01000000 → 10000000
```

Therefore:

```text
LED1 → LED2 → LED3 → LED4 → LED5 → LED6 → LED7 → LED8
```

After LED8, the sequence starts again from LED1.

##  Embedded C Program

```c
#include <reg51.h>

void delay(void)
{
     unsigned int i, j;

    for(i = 0; i < 500; i++)
    {
        for(j = 0; j < 120; j++);
    }
}

void main(void)
{
    unsigned char i;

    while(1)
    {
        for(i = 0; i < 8; i++)
        {
            P2 = (1 << i);
            delay();
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Program Explanation

### Header File

```c
#include <reg51.h>
```
This header file provides the definitions required to access the registers of the 8051 microcontroller.

### Port Configuration

Port 2 is used to control the eight LEDs.

```c
P2 = (1 << i);
```

The expression shifts a single `1` bit from P2.0 toward P2.7.

### LED Sequence

| Step | P2 Value | Binary     | LED  |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ---- |
| 1    | `01H`    | `00000001` | LED1 |
| 2    | `02H`    | `00000010` | LED2 |
| 3    | `04H`    | `00000100` | LED3 |
| 4    | `08H`    | `00001000` | LED4 |
| 5    | `10H`    | `00010000` | LED5 |
| 6    | `20H`    | `00100000` | LED6 |
| 7    | `40H`    | `01000000` | LED7 |
| 8    | `80H`    | `10000000` | LED8 |
